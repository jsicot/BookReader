BookReader (plugin for Omeka)
=============================


Summary
-----------

This plugin adds [Internet Archive BookReader] into [Omeka].
The IA BookReader is used to view books from the Internet Archive online and can
also be used to view other books.
BookReader plugin for Omeka allows you to create online flip book from image
files constituting an item.

See demo of the [embedded version] or use in [fullscreen mode].


Installation
------------

- Upload the BookReader plugin folder into your plugins folder on the server;
- Activate it from the admin → Settings → Plugins page
- Click the Configure link to add the following
    - Logo URL for toolbar viewer (reader)
    - Favicon URL for viewer (reader) pages
    - Hex color for toolbar viewer (reader)
    - Enable embed viewer in item/show page
    - Number of pages in Embed mode (1 or 2)
    - Embed all functions (0 for none or 1 for all)
    - The width of the inline frame (Embedded Simple Viewer)
    - The height of the inline frame (Embedded Simple Viewer)

The viewer is always available at `http://www.example.com/viewer/show/{item id}`.
If you want to embed it, add this code in the item/show.php file of your theme:

```
    <?php
    fire_plugin_hook('public_items_show', array(
        'view' => $this,
        'item' => $item,
        'page' => '0',
        'embed_functions' => false,
    ));
```

This hook is generally enabled by default in themes, but you can add options if
wanted. If an option is not set, the parameters in the config page will be used.
Image number starts from '0' with default functions.
